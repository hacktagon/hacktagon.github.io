A couple weeks ago, Microsoft released the [MS16-063][ms16-063]{:target="_blank"} security bulletin for their monthly Patch Tuesday (June 2016) security updates. It addressed vulnerabilities that affected Internet Explorer. Among other things, the patch fixes a memory corruption vulnerability in `jscript9.dll` related to _TypedArray_ and _DataView_.

Second paragraph


### Theme

We begin with comparing the May and June versions of `jscript9.dll` in BinDiff:

In pseudo-code, it looks like the following:

```cpp
inline Var DirectGetItem(__in uint32 index)
{
    if (index < GetLength())
    {
        TypeName* typedBuffer = (TypeName*)buffer;
        return JavascriptNumber::ToVar(
            typedBuffer[index], GetScriptContext()
        );
    }
    return GetLibrary()->GetUndefined();
}
```
