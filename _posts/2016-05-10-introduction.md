Hello, everybody! It's actually been a couple months since we started operating, but we've been busy with traveling and stuff.
We are glad to finally roll our <s>website</s> blog where we can share our findings!

For people who don't know us very well, our researchers have done some work related to these topics:

#### Research
* Practical Control Flow Integrity
* Software-based Remote Attestation
* Binary Randomization via Binary Rewriting
* Automotive Security
* Vulnerability Research

#### Commercial Work
* Trusted Computing (Chain of Trust) Verification
* Security Audit on Source &amp; Binary Code

Do you have really challenging problems to solve? Contact <a href="mailto:support@theori.io">us</a>!<br>
We are always open to opportunities with interesting work.


Also, we moved to a new office last week. Here are some pictures:
